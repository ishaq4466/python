* [Use case of Dictionary](useCaseOfDictionary.py)




### Important funtions to remember:

1. re.findall(r'\b[a-z]{3,15}\b', text_string) 

*return all the words with the number of characters in the range [3-15]. 
Starting from 3 will help in avoiding words that we may not be 
interested in counting their frequency like if, of, in, etc., 
and words having a length larger than 15 might not be correct words.*
