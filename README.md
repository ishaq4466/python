# Program for word frequency in text file: [Code](https://github.com/ishaq4466/python/blob/master/wordFreq.py)
## Important funtions used:
## 1. re.findall(r'\b[a-z]{3,15}\b', text_string) : 

return all the words with the number of characters in the range [3-15]. Starting from 3 will help in avoiding words that we may not be interested in counting their frequency like if, of, in, etc., and words having a length larger than 15 might not be correct words
