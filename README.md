### Program for word frequency in text file: [Code](https://github.com/ishaq4466/python/blob/master/wordFreq.py)

### Important funtions to remember:
 1. re.findall(r'\b[a-z]{3,15}\b', text_string) 

 *return all the words with the number of characters in the range [3-15]. 
 Starting from 3 will help in avoiding words that we may not be 
 interested in counting their frequency like if, of, in, etc., 
 and words having a length larger than 15 might not be correct words.*
